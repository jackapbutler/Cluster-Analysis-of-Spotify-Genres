# Cluster-Analysis-of-Spotify-Genres
I used a dataset of Spotify songs from three genres; Rock, Pop and Acoustic. After examining the Within Sum of Squares and Calinski-Harabasz index I concluded that 2 or 3 distinct clusters would be the most appropriate for this dataset. I then examined these two choices using a silhouette plot. We can observe below that K = 2 is a much better fit to the data than the previous K = 3 due to the lower average silhouette.
